you need to be a domain admin for this to work
i created a shortcut with thisin the launch line
C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -file "\\<server>\Users\Public\Information Technology\Admin Tools\UserScript.ps1"

This is a script we use for our backup domain admin, in our case HR, without giving them all the AD tools they would never need.
